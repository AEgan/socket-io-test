Learning socketio
===

playing around with node/express/socketio to learn more, use git and github, and prepare for final assignment.

This is a basic chat example that lets you talk with other people connected. Comments are there if you would like to look around.

If you are running locally, make sure you have node installed and run 
```
npm install
```

then

```
node app
```
Which will start a local server on port 12345. This port number can be changed in app.js

Tags are now being escapted on output to avoid xss, even though this will probably only ever be run on my computer

Will work on that later lol.
